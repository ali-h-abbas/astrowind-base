      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        My journey with meditation began during a challenging period in my corporate career. Stressed and burned out, 
        I discovered meditation and experienced such a profound transformation that I knew I had to share this gift with others.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        After training extensively in Vipassana, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and various contemplative traditions, 
        I left the corporate world to dedicate myself to teaching full-time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Today, I blend ancient wisdom with modern neuroscience to create accessible, practical programs 
        that fit into busy lives. My mission is to help you find the peace and clarity you deserve.
